    <p>These endangered cats are nearly impossible to see—they've even earned the nickname “ghost of the mountains.” Their
    spotted coats act as cloaks of invisibility by blending into the rocky mountains of the 12 Central Asian countries where
    the cats live: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan,
    and Uzbekistan. Their range spans about two million square miles, which is about half the size of Greenland.</p>
